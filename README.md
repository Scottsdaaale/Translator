# Translator App 
Hello! Thank you for checking out my app. We are not translating world languages here, this app allows you to translate ASCII, Binary, and Morse code. You can translate ASCII to Binary/MC, Binary to ASCII/MC, MC to ASCII/Binary, text to ASCII/Binary/MC, and ASCII/Binary/MC to text. It is easily scalable for the future as well. Hope you enjoy!
